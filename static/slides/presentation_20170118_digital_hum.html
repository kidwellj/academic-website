					<h1>Teaching Theological Ethics</h1>
					<p>Goal: To give students agency in course planning; design term 2 teaching around student-led presentations.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Low-fi beginnings: whiteboarding topics</li>
						<li>Going digital: Fed 35 topics into a digital survey</li>
						<li>First roadblock: canvas survey tool stinks</li>
						<li>Second roadblock: central IT unwilling to deploy lightweight, open-source alternative without "a business case"</li>
						<li>Solution: rolled my own instance of LimeSurvey on personal webhost (reclaim.com)</li>
						<li>Example: <a href=http://sccs-survey.org.uk/index.php/162945>http://sccs-survey.org.uk/index.php/162945</a></li>
					</ul>
					</section>

						<ul>
							<li>Third roadblock: Need to level playing field for students without tablets and smartphones</li>
							<li>Solution: Thanks to Arts IT! Discovered a big box full of iPads</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>Results?</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Worked well. iPads had trouble with wifi, but students just shared the 8-10 that worked.</p>
						<p>Really interesting differences in engagement styles with the tool</p>
						<p>Have a fantastic store of data I need to parse through to see how topic choices map onto student demographics</p>

						<h1>Research?</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Topic: climate change and low-carbon action in religious communities</p>
						<p>Digital solution: Generate a map to consolidate practitioner relationships; resource third sector groups; parse demographics</p>
					</section>
					<section><h1>Research challenge?</h1></section>
					<section><p>Data exists, but huge problems with transparency, accuracy, sustainability</p></section>
					<section>
						<h2>Technical solution?</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>OPEN EVERYTHING! Source! Data! Tools!</h2>
						<p>Mapping tools: QGIS, CartoDB, D3.js, carto.css</p>
						<p>Project website: Jekyll via github</p>
						<p>Sample: <a href="https://mapping.community">http://mapping.community</a></p>

					<section>
						<p>The next few rabbit trails:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Decision time: Hacking resources list vs. Hacking a canvas wiki page</li>
							<li>Moving everything to github/gitlab</li>
							<li>Writing some "reproducible research" using RMarkdown</li>
							<li>Social network analysis</li>
							<li>Getting a discourse server (https://github.com/discourse/discourse)</li>
