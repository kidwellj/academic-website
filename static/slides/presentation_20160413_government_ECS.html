				<h1>Our Findings?</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>Eco-Congregations tend to stay "off the radar"</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>No mention in 2015 Changeworks study (cf. p. 31; Table 7.2)</li>
					<li>Active but silent partner behind some Community Development Trusts and Transition Groups, but also working in some communities in an independent capacity.</li>
					<li>Partnerships with large environmental charities<br>
					(RSPB, WWF)</li>
				</ul>

			<section>
				<h2>Reasons for Action?<br>
				<span style="font-size:0.5em">Climate justice, stewardship, love of nature,				intergenerational concern...</span>
				</h2>

			<h3>A place where values are linked with pro-environmental behaviours, but more than this as well...</h3>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h2>Hidden pro-Climate Impacts?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Trialing new ideas for sustainability<br>
				(case study: solar panels, community gardens, boilers)</li>
				<li>Provide personnel and "endurance" for CCF grants, sustainability projects, venues for other groups</li>
				<li>Linking spirituality with environmental concern</li>
				<li>Validating "moral" aspect to climate change mitigation</li>
				<li>Highlighting the international aspect of climate impacts and relational side to mitigation</li>

		<h2>For discussion</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>How can our research assist government in improving outreach to and targetting of and support for religious communities in Scotland on low-carbon activities?</li>
		</ul>

		<ol>
			<li>Covering the spectrum, from "uninvolved" to "climate champions"</li>
			<li>Mobilising values frameworks, but also affirming the role of lay knowledge in reckoning with climate change</li>
			<li>CCF engagement with churches</li>
			<li>RPP3</li>
