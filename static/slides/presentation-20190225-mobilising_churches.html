## What does successful mobilisation look like?

---

class: middle

## My definition:

- Improved public visibility on issues of concern
- Enhanced engagement with poliymakers
- Impact! ... responsive action on both household and public policy levels

---

In practice: marches, demonstations, "buzz", large crowds, energy, surprises...

## "Mobilisation" Caveat #1:

---

class: middle

Not just *action* but **quality of** action

- Implies a better understanding of the underpinning issues (do we understand what is at stake in mobilisation on climate change, or do we just "feel" it?)
- Involves reflection on effective forms it might take
- May generate less visible forms of enhanced relationality: new alliances and an improved basis for future political action.

---

class: center, middle

## "Mobilisation" Caveat #2:

---

class: middle

We (Christians) have some specific barriers
1. **Policymakers** do not understand how Christians are engaging with environmental issues

---

class: middle

We (Christians) have some specific barriers
1. Policymakers do not understand how Christians are engaging with environmental issues
2. **Scholars** do not understand how Christians are engaging with environmental issues


---

class: middle

We (Christians) have some specific barriers
1. Policymakers do not understand how Christians are engaging with environmental issues
2. Scholars do not understand how Christians are engaging with environmental issues
3. **Christians** do not understand how Christians are engaging with environmental issues

---

class: middle

## Other barriers:

1. Maturing new groups beyond initial enthusiasm for issues
2. Connecting up calls for individual action with areas where National level policy is required
3. Making the "long game" - sustaining action past the 2-3 year mark towards 10/20/30 year-long campaigns
4. Forming and naming secular partnerships
5. Opposition from within (deniers!)
6. Demographics / denominations with lack of engagement
7. Cross-pressuring effects (other strategic foci, pressure from gassroots vs. denomination, other similar overlapping efforts)
8. Gap between the top and bottom, tendency towards centralised top-down models
9. Focus on building fabric, metrics, carbon management

---

class: middle

My solution: establish an **integrative scholarly field** in engagement with policymakers, scholars, and churches.

- Eco-theology has struggled to engage with mainstream Christian scholarly reflection
- Executives can tend to privilege social psychology and economics over anthropology (e.g. "bar charts" over "books"!)
- Social scientists have reinforced rather than questioned stereotypes about Christainity
- Political leadership lacks literacy about religion in Britain


.footnote[.red[*] Note: secular policymakers and scholars are waking up to the significance of religion and spiritual values. For more on this, see my [Cambridge presentation](https://jeremykidwell.info/files/presentations/presentation_20180130_cambridge_energy.html) and read our paper on "Religion and social values for sustainability" in [Sustainability Science](https://jeremykidwell.info/publications/2019_religion_social_values/) just out this year.]

## My work involves:

- Working with theological reflection, ethnography of religious environmentalism and data science. 
- This is *theologically* informed study of Christian environmentalists flowing into a conversation with geographers, policical scientists, anthropologists, sociologists, economists.
- Communicate this research to public policy audience, third sector, and Christian communities.

Note: *readable executive summary of my research can be found here*:

## Projects:

- 4 year study of Eco-Congregation Scotland (2013-2016) with interdisciplinary team
- Theology & Extinction (2017-2019) research network
- Spiritual Landscapes (fieldwork: 2019-2023)
- Mapping Environmental Action (2013-)
- On-going research collaborations with: A'Rocha, Eco-Congregation Scotland, RSPB, Development Trust Assoc. Scotland, Transition Network, Ecolise.eu, Permaculture Association, C of E, Methodist church, Earth Ministry (USA), and a few more.

---

## Eco-Congregation Study:

- Key question: Do Christians frame climate change differently from secular env. groups?
- 44 eco-Congregations (over 50 interviews)
- Comparator interviews with Transition Scotland groups
- Analysis of 200+ applications to ECS (2005-2014)
- Worked as an ECS award assessor
- Participant observation in network events, analysis of websites, social networks
- Board member of Stop Climate Chaos (2015-2017), interviews with elite NGO actors

## So what have we learned so far?

---

class: middle

### There are **four different types** of *community environmental group* at the grassroots:

- The **.red[lone voices]**: a single person working in the midst of either indifference or hostility in the wider community.
- The **.red[local heroes]**: as above but with sanction and/or indirect support by the wider community. 
- **.red[Small but active]**: a small and generally self-contained group of 3-12 persons.
- Large with differential involvements (**.red[LDI]**): many people with varying levels of participation.

---

class: center, middle

### We need to find ways to engage and support all four types.

Take-away: Green groups are diverse in structure & motivation. It is not safe to assume your church is a template.

---

# Denominations?

We found that denominations are not always the most meaningful divisions.

*At the level of .red[community and region], orientations towards environmental action may coalesce around local community concerns and/or .red[denominational structure].* 

Put another way, we may find that Christian Eco-Groups cluster in two genres:

- Cluster 1: churches which are hierarchical/bureaucratic  
(CofE, CofS, RC, Methodist, etc.)

- Cluster 2: churches which lack formal meta-organisationsal structure  
(Quaker, evangelical, baptist, etc.)

- Networks (ECS, Green Christian, etc.) tend to neglect cluster 2

- Hebridean example

## How do Christians mobilise? 

---

class: center, middle

### Key context 1. 

## Christians are modest about their achievements

---

class: middle

### Possible consequences: 

- Possibly lower ambition re: grants and projects
- Hidden achievements
- Self-description (and public opinion) is dampened
- Comparison to other groups is often negative
- Work by Christians working in other contexts (FOE, Green Peace, community agriculture, etc.) may be ascribed to other secular groups

---

class: center, middle

### Key context 2. 

## Christian eco-groups focus on local community

e.g. Churches are good at forming and running committees, and sub-committees...

---

class: middle

### Possible consequences: 

- Default .red[focus on building fabric] as site for eco-interventions (solar panels, boiler replacement, windows, lighting, etc.) and .red[church-yard] (if not managed by council)
- "Slow" pace of work (which can impact planning and funding horizons)

#### *Note: these are not bad things!*

---

class: middle

## Take-away 1: issues are not the driver

Whereas for national networks and campaigning organisations, "action" and "issues" can often serve as the main driver.

In contrast, with community groups, the opposite is often the case.

Groups are driven by community formation and support, and issues come afterwards..red[*]

.footnote[.red[*] For more on this, check out ["Christian climate care: Slow change, modesty, and eco-theo-citizenship"](https://jeremykidwell.info/publications/2018_geo/) - hot off the press in 2018.]

---

## Take-away 2. churches are a place for niche & experimentation

.right-column[Specific policy interventions can be helped by a "proof of concept"

Smaller community groups can help to form a "niche" which can serve as laboratories for testing out new ideas.red[*]]

.footnote[.red[*] For more on this, check out: René Kemp, Johan Schot & Remco Hoogma, 1998.

# Tactics and Tools for Mobilisation

---

class: center, middle

## Strategy 1: Target engagement

---

class: center, middle

The majority of Eco-groups involve a small unfunded group of volunteers.

They work really hard but **their work can be precarious**. Small resources / encouragement can provide an outsize effect. Similarly, for setbacks.

---

class: center, middle

Community groups and churches can have tremendous **impact within a small space** and have **access to social networks** which are unknown and inaccessible to NGOs and National leadership.

We're often used to the "direct" approach to the public, but might we find ways to treat community groups as intermediaries?

---

class: center, middle

Practical suggestion 1: *Alongside mass campaigns, and broad denomination-level outreach, .red[consider sub-setting groups] for targetted outreach and engagement.

Practical suggestion 2: Support community anchors as "beacon" projects; invest in established projects to leverage as support agents for new projects

---

## Strategy 2: Reach the spectrum

An outsize amount of resource goes to London and the Central Belt in Scotland.

Some areas are "sleeping" and others are "soldiering"

We need to wake up the sleepers and support the soldiers.

---

## Strategy 3: Focus on development

NGOs have limited resources and need quick campaign "wins"

Yet most campaigning in the UK and attention in Christian media focusses on Climate Change

We need to broaden our portfolio of issues.

In some cases, this will require development and education. In others, we may be surprised by the energy around issues like extinction and land use.

Action %
- Energy efficiency 79%
- Waste or litter management or recycling 78%
- Links made with development NGO (SCIAF, Oxfam, Christian Aid, Fair Trade) 69%
- Gardening project 42%
- Sought funding or audit for external funding for energy efficiency/renewable energy project (e.g. Climate Challenge Fund, European grant) 33%
- Engaged in some form of direct political action (mailing, contacted MSP/MP etc.) 30%
- Activity focus on animals or wilderness 29%
- Practical action for “neighbour care” (free meals, outreach, etc.) 28%
- Links made with secular environmental NGOs (e.g. Friends of the Earth) 26%
- Food production, growing, or ethical sourcing 8%
- Solar or wind energy project 6%
