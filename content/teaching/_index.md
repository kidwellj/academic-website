Included here are a range of materials which support my teaching. In particular, I have several FAQ (frequently asked questions) and guidance documents which are meant to provide detail for common questions asked by students.

Forms of guidance included here are:
- [An undergraduate dissertation FAQ](guidance/faq_ug_diss/)
- [My reference letter policy](guidance/reference_letter_policy)
- [My general communication policy](guidance/communication_policy), e.g. "How the heck can I reach Jeremy?"

I generally put up materials to support each of my modules at the University of Birmingham here as well. Content coming soon!

And finally, I tend to develop open educational resources as part of my work both in and outside the University. You can find an index of these here as well. (also coming soon)
