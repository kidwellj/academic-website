This event is being co-hosted by T&R EDI and a group of MA students studying at the University of Birmingham. The workshop aims to explore Queer theology across a range of religious traditions – so towards that end we’ve invited a few speakers to join us and help frame up the conversation, including Amanullah De Sondy (University College Cork).
 
The event will take a practical focus on queering higher education: how theology can be construed as a problem and a resource for thinking constructively about gender inclusivity and how we navigate that within a research/learning context. We’ll think together about how learners can navigate their personal sitatedness, theological background and religious communities and how inclusiveness is constructed in those different contexts.
