What else lives in this humanscape of concrete and stone? What spaces do we allow for our fellow non-human residents? How do we link them up for safe passage?
 
In this walk we will be looking at which species live in the area, where they’re struggling and where they’re surviving. We will explore ‘green infrastructure’ and how it can generate a richer, more than human community.
