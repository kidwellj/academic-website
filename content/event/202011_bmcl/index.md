summary: "I'm learned a huge amount from the members of this colloquia who have been working for 2 years to compile theological insights, best practices and outreach strategies which can more intentionally connect with Black Majority churches in the UK. I'll be sharing a bit of my experience decolonising British environmentalism over the past few years and getting input from this group of experts."
