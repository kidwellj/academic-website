Three Faiths: One Question

Why do good people do bad things?

Christian, Muslim, and Sikh speakers explore the concepts and assumptions that underlie each religion, and how these lead to differing worldviews. Inspired by the diversity of our city, this Veritas Forum will engage in rigorous, respectful, and honest debate about how three of our major faith groups answer some of lifeâ€™s most challenging questions. Our starting point will be the question of why good people do bad things, on which all three religions have a very different perspective. There will be opportunity for Q&A with the audience.

Speakers will include Revd Dr Jeremy Kidwell (University of Birmingham), and Imam Nasir Zameer (Abrahamic Foundation Smethwick). The event will be moderated by Revd Jessica Foster (Church of England / Near Neighbours).

This event follows the success of our inaugural University of Birmingham Veritas Forum event in March 2017, which tackled questions of science and truth from a Christian perspective.

Thursday 15th November 2018 7.30-9.30pm

Avon Room, University Centre, University of Birmingham
