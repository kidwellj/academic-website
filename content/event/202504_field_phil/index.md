Co-hosted with Michelle Bastian and Adam Frank, this workshop brought together a group of philosophers to explore emerging methods in field philosophy. To start off the event, Michelle, Adam and I provided a roundtable reflection on "What are philosophers able to do?" with a response from Vincianne Despret.
