I offered a paper on the ineffability of neurodivergent distress for the Digital Wellbeing Workshop for '[Imagining Wellbeing](https://imaginingwellbeing.bham.ac.uk/)' in the [Centre for Urban Wellbeing](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-urban-wellbeing/home-page.aspx). This is part of my ongoing work thinking into neurodivergent experience using the tools of phenomenology and intersubjectivity.
