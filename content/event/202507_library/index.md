This is a talk I gave by request to our library services team as part of their monthly CPD series. I cover some of the basics (in response to some very good questions that the team sent me ahead of time) in terms of vocabulary and framing neurodiversity at work and offer some suggestions for successfully navigating and celebrating diversity in team working. I also produced a short sheet defining terms which I'm happy to share [here](talk/talking-about-neurodiversity-at-work/terms.docx)
