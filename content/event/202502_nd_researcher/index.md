This talk is aimed at any neurodivergent students and researchers at UOB starting a research vocation, from undergrads contemplating their dissertation up to PhD researchers working towards their viva. In it, Jeremy Kidwell (associate professor in theological ethics) will talk about how to survive and thrive as a neurodivergent researcher, framed around his own experiences as an autistic scholar and work supporting ND students and colleagues over the past decade. The talk will cover how to navigate self-advocacy and community building, engaging with concepts of disability and difference, and trauma-informed approaches to developing and executing research projects. The talk will be recorded and there will be separate follow-on (online and in-person) workshops where interested researchers can engage in the content in a more discursive (but still very neurodivergent) way. You can expect an environment that is stim and fidget toy friendly with an atmosphere of radical self-acceptance. Hope to see you there!
