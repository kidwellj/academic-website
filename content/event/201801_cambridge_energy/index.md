I'm very much looking forward to delivering a paper at Cambridge on 30 January 2018. My host is the [Energy@Cambridge](https://www.energy.cam.ac.uk) research initiative. My full title for the presentation is: "Slow energy policy in a time of global emergencies: the perils and promises of energy policy and religious communities"

I'll be sharing some of my analysis of data that has been collected over four years (2013-2017) in collaboration with Scottish grassroots environmental groups, particularly Eco-Congregations. 

You can also see a [brief video interview](https://vimeo.com/253660583) I did to introduce the paper and my research in this area.

Also thrilled to note that my friend Jonathan Chaplin will be chairing the session and personal scholarly hero [Mike Hulme](https://mikehulme.org/climate-change-and-the-significance-of-religion/) will be responding to my paper.
