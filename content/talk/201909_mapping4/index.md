What would we create if we put the same time, energy and resources into building ecosystems as we do on ourselves? What structure and systems can we imagine, and how could they bridge the gap between ourselves and the other 8.7 million life-forms on the planet?
 
The Manuals is an ongoing project by Something & Son to create an open platform of solutions and responses to the ecological crisis. Our final walk will explore these ideas, sharing visions and solutions. This crowd-wisdom will be woven into a map published by the Design Museum.
