summary: "I'm delighted to be invited to share current research as part of this really important symposium on how Muslims in Britain engage with sustainability in the UK. In my presentation, I share some reflection that has been underway for several years now about how the environmental sector has been the site of racialised privilege, and in turn, how I think work ought to be structured in adressing this, particuarly for white privileged folks like me.
