The purpose of this afternoon will be to take stock of what is possible in the digital humanities (at the University of Birmingham). Any member of academic staff in CAL is welcome – and let me stress that this isn’t just for serious programmers or data analysts, but anyone who may be considering how to take their research in a digital direction. We will have a series of presenters from across the college serving as provocateurs, showing off cool and useful tools and methodologies, and highlighting research challenges they have tackled with digital tools. This will be a true workshop – so will involve properly facilitated discussions for the second half as we explore possible themes or projects with one another. We’ll also have a range of talented people working in BEAR and support services to help connect up some of these aspirations with some of the in-house tech and support staff we now (in some cases very recently!) have available.

I facilitated the workshop and did a brief presentation on the geo-humanities which you can view here: https://jeremykidwell.info/files/presentations/presentation_06142018_dh-forum.html
