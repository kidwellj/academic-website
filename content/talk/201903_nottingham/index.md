I'm very much looking forward to delivering a paper at Nottingham for the School of Geography in March 2019. Here's my abstract:

> In this presentation, I share some analysis of the results of a 4 year study into Scottish Eco-Congregations (2013-2016). I highlight some features of Scottish environmentalism as it is expressed in churches through the social movement "Eco-Congregation," particularly focussing on the mismatch between funding instruments such as the climate challenge fund and the kind of long-run, parochially focussed environmental citizenship expressed in this context, what I call eco-theo-citizenship. I also provide some scalar analysis, towards broader environmental policy applications, indicating some ways that Christian environmentalism is institutionally encapsulated, from local to international organisations.
