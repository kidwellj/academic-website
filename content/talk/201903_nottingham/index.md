summary: "Paper given to the University of Nottingham School of Geography seminar."
abstract: "In this presentation, I share some analysis of the results of a 4 year study into Scottish Eco-Congregations (2013-2016). I highlight some features of Scottish environmentalism as it is expressed in churches through the social movement Eco-Congregation, particularly focussing on the mismatch between funding instruments such as the climate challenge fund and the kind of long-run, parochially focussed environmental citizenship expressed in this context, what I call eco-theo-citizenship. I also provide some scalar analysis, towards broader environmental policy applications, indicating some ways that Christian environmentalism is institutionally encapsulated, from local to international organisations."
