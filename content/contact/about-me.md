I was born in Seattle, WA (USA) and did my undergraduate studies there at Seattle Pacific University in Music and English Literature. After college, I continued IT work that had already been ongoing since my teenage hacker days moving into the telecommunications sector and working as a technician and eventually lead technical trainer for an exchange carrier based in Rochester, NY. During lunch breaks I'd steal away to the public library and practice Greek and Latin, thinking that I might pursue graduate work in Medieval Studies. When my partner finished her Masters degree in Social Work, we moved to Vancouver, BC so that I could take up further interdisciplinary studies in Theology at Regent College. Finding expatriate life suited us well, we made an even more dramatic move to Scotland, where I received my Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh. My PhD focussed on the ethics of design, resulting in what eventually became my first book, *The Theology of Craft and the Craft of Work* but this inquiry had a decidedly ecological inflection. 

Bringing this interest in ecological ethics to the foreground, while in the final stages of my PhD, I co-authored a large grant application with my doctoral supervisor and we were awarded about Â£860k in research funding to pursue an emerging and joint interest in Eco-Congregation Scotland. I was written into the project as full-time post-doctoral researcher and in this capacity I managed the project fieldwork and impact portfolio and also conducted independent ethnographic and philosophical research. It was here that I discovered a love for mixed methods and field philosophy, connecting dots between themes I found in late-modern continental philosophy, interviews I conducted with Scottish environmental activists and between the dynamics of local environmental politics and geospatial data. 

My research continues to engage my interests in all these themes - data and technology, craft, commons and design, eco-theology, and activist ethnography. You can browse my publications and talks to get more of a sense of how I interweave these things in my current research and outreach.
