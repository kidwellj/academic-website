As [an autistic academic](https://blog.jeremykidwell.info/category/neurodivergence/), I'm involved in work across a variety of arenas to make academia a safe and friendly place for neurodiversity. I've run a bespoke tutorial group for ND UGs for several years and provided training to a variety of groups across campus and elsewhere. Underpinning this work lies a concern interwoven with my scholarship in activist studies, ecotheology and environmental philosophy that forms of diversity add strength to ecologies, societies, and organisations. In this project, I'm bringing together scholars across a variety of fields to probe forms of divergence (especially, but not exclusively neurodivergence) especially those located in the undercommons and on the margins as spaces of creativity and dynamism. Current research on this project is focussed around (1) an inquiry in design studies and ethics around the build environment and (2) neurodivergent spiritualities.
