In the UK, people of colour typically have greater vulnerability to environmental risks including potential harm from negative climate change impacts. The voices, knowledge and experiences of UK people of colour are also under-represented in the climate change discourse, the environmental movement and global solutions. UK people of colour have unique and different perspectives on climate change causes and solutions for their local communities. They also have unique perspectives of being connected to international communities affected first and worst by climate change. These connections haven't been explored in detail. In this project, along with an amazing team of activists and researchers, we deployed the first large scale academic study (n=1008) asking ethnic minorities about their opinions and experiences of climate change.
