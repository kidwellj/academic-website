One of my longest-running research projects, this inquiry began in the context of three other projects: an AHRC/ESRC joint-funded project I co-designed with Michael Northcott "Ancestral Time", Michelle Bastian's [Temporal Design](http://www.temporaldesign.eca.ed.ac.uk/temporal-design/) project and an exploration of "Deep Time" which arose out of the Edinburgh Environmental Humanities Network. For this project, which has been underway since 2015, I've been working slowly on a book manuscript where I argue that we need to move away from time studies and temporality which fix time as a homogenous entity to be understood, towards the idea of time reckoning, which takes different temporal modalities like "deep time," "tradition," and "history" as forms of temporal navigation for humans and other creatures.
