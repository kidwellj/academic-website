#      title: My title
      text: My doctoral research sought to reveal ways that ancient narratives about craft-work might illuminate present quandaries in business, engineering, and design surrounding excellence, creativity, property, and more. Along these lines I have an abiding interest interplay of ethics, design, technology, and economics. Since 2013, my research has taken on the contemporary context more directly and placed my interest in environmental ethics in the foreground, using data science and ethnographic methods to investigate how moral community and political mobilisation are being generated in the context of religion in response to environmental change.
