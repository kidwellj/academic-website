# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this article, I present on survey research conducted in 2021 into UK pupil (n=933, aged 16-19) attitudes towards study in theology and religious studies (TRS) at University. We found that positive sentiments towards study in TRS significantly exceed the proportion of University students who matriculate into TRS degree programmes, with some variation across different subsets. Respondents also indicated some correlation between interest in studying theology, religion, philosophy and ethics, with a clear (if partial) sense that TRS degrees were interdisciplinary subjects. The article is reproducible research, written using R and Quarto and full code and data can be downloaded separately.
