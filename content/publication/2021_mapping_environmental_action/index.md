This article (PDF coming soon!) presents a GIS-based analysis using R which analyses the footprint of several environmental groups in Scotland against standard demographics. This is my first attempt to use RMarkdown in a sustained way, so it's taking a long time. You can find the current (reproducible) codebase in a github repository here: [https://github.com/kidwellj/mapping_environmental_action] and browse a compiled version of the paper here: [http://mapenvcom.jeremykidwell.info/mapping_draft.html]. The latter has compiled versions of the charts and graphs and will eventually have some interactive slippy maps.
