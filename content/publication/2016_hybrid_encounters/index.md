abstract: "Over the past century, environmental scientists have developed a range of conservation approaches. Each of these, from management to restoration has embedded within it certain dualisms which create exclusive spaces or agencies for &ldquo;human&rdquo; and &ldquo;nature.&rdquo; I begin with a critique of these binaries as they occur in philosopher, Florence R. Kluckhohn’s influential model and in more recent narratives about the &ldquo;Anthropocene,&rdquo; and then turn to examine some of the novel features of &ldquo;reconciliation ecology&rdquo; as it has recently been deployed in the environmental sciences. Though this model is beginning to see wider use by scientists, it has not yet been explored within a religious framework. Taking up Miroslav Volf’s suggestion that reconciliation involves a &ldquo;double strategy&rdquo; I highlight ways that reconciliation can (1) provide a viable model for promoting an &ldquo;embrace&rdquo; of the other and (2) better integrate the past history of negative human biotic impacts."
