Out today in the journal International Affairs, my article on Mapping Religious Environmental Politics. The model + analysis there is especially for folks in public policy seeking to better engage with religious groups on environmental policy (https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/96/2/343/5775739). With special thx to my colleague Katherine Brown for editing!
